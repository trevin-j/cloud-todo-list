Each collection represents one user. (Remember that user "accounts" are not secure and not really accounts. It is more like having multiple profiles.)

A user can have multiple documents.

Each document is a todo-item. There are different types of todo-items.
At the time this project was first completed, there is only one type of todo-item: action.
(Once the transition is made to support secure accounts, more types will be added.)

Each document is formatted as the following:
todo-item {
    'type': 'action',         # (only option for now)
    'title': 'TITLE HERE',
    'desc': 'DESCRIPTION HERE',
    'due': 'DATE TO BE COMPLETED',
    'created': 'DATE CREATED',
    'is_complete': 'True'     # True if completed, else False
}
